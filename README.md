# docker-Install-Script
this is the script that have worked for me always when trying to install docker on parrot security os 

# Steps to install docker 


```
git clone this repo
cd in docker-install-Script
sudo chmod +x DockerInstall.sh
sudo ./DockerInstall.sh
```

do not forget to run it as root to check after the system reboots if docker got installed fine
```
$ docker run hello-world
Hello from Docker!
```
